Features
 - Students on the roster can be stored in any order. (ArrayList)

 - Students on the waitlist should be stored in the order they were added. (Built-in ArrayList)

 - A student can only be added to the course if they have paid their tuition. (Student class)

 - A student cannot be on the roster or waitlist more than once. (isAlreadyRegistered())

 - A student cannot be on both the roster and the waitlist. (isOnRoster(), isOnWaitlist())

 - If a student on the roster drops the course, the first student from the waitlist should be added to the roster (and removed from the waitlist). (dropStudent(studentID), addStudent(String studentID), addStudentFromWaitlist())

 - addStudent (String studentID) // Fill roster, then fill waitlist if roster is full

 - When searching for whether a student is on the roster or waitlist, compare the Student ids to see if a student is a match. isRegistered(String studentID)

 - getStudent(String studentID)
